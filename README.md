# Simple Calculator using Atmega32
#### This is an embedded systems project that uses an Atmega32 microcontroller to create a simple calculator. The Atmega32 is a powerful microcontroller with a wide range of peripherals and features, making it a popular choice for embedded systems projects.

#### The project utilizes 3 push buttons and an LCD screen to enable the user to perform simple mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user can input two one-digit numbers using the push buttons and the results are displayed on the LCD screen.

#### One of the key aspects of the project is the use of input/output interfaces, specifically push buttons and an LCD screen, to enable user interaction and display the results. The project also demonstrates my ability to program the microcontroller to interpret the button presses and perform the corresponding mathematical operations.

### The following is a video demonstration of the calculator
